Ray Tracer
This is a program for rendering basic 3D shapes using ray tracing in C++. The program reads in a text file continaing formatted information about the color and position of the shapes and light source, and stores them in a linked list using C++ pointers. It then uses ray tracing to render each object in space and perform realistic lighting calculations based on the position of the light source. With this project, I learned the underlying algorithms behind basic ray tracing which are used to render everything from video games to spaceship models.
